A portfolio of some of the data science and machine learning based projects I have worked on.

## [Project 1: Regression model.](https://github.com/Taranks7/Drug-Discovery-Data-Science-roject) ##
### [Bioinfomatics Project on Drug Discovery for Coronavirus: Project Overview.](https://github.com/Taranks7/Drug-Discovery-Data-Science-Project) ### 
- Retrieve biological activity data of target proteins and compounds from the ChEMBL database
- Identify compound or molecule which can inhibit the function of the coronavirus 3C-like proteinase
- Biological activity data used to train a regression model to predict pIC50 values

## [Project 2: Deep learning model.](https://github.com/Taranks7/OpenCV_segmentation) ## 
### [Deep learning based CMR image segmentation: Project Overview.](https://github.com/Taranks7/OpenCV_segmentation) ### 
- Developed an automated process, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and OpenCV, to segment (cardiovascular magnetic resonance) CMR images.
- Implement and trained the deep learning based model through augmenting provided training dataset.
- Model had an accuracy score of approximately 0.83 at labelling CMR images into the following classes: background, left ventricle , right ventricle and myocardium - shown on the rightmost tile in figure 2 below.

## [Project 3: Data Visualisation.](https://github.com/Taranks7/RDM_practicalproject) ## 
### [Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of visual stimuli: Project Overview](https://github.com/Taranks7/RDM_practicalproject) ### 
- RSA characterizes the representation of stimuli in an individual's brain or a computational model 
- Created a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) from 0 to 0.05 for participants using pairs of visual stimuli, reflecting percieved similairy between the stimuli
- Calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient between pairs of stimuli to quantify the level of dissimilarity
