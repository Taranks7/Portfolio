# Taranjit's Portfolio # 
This is a portfolio of some of the data science and machine learning based projects I have worked on.

### [Project 1: Bioinfomatics Project on Drug Discovery for Coronavirus: Project Overview](https://github.com/Taranks7/Drug-Discovery-Data-Science-Project) ### 
- Retrieve biological activity data of target proteins and compounds from the ChEMBL database
- Identify compound or molecule which can inhibit the function of the coronavirus 3C-like proteinase
- Biological activity data used to train a regression model to predict pIC50 values

### [Project 2: Deep learning based CMR image segmentation: Project Overview](https://github.com/Taranks7/OpenCV_segmentation) ### 
- Developed an automated process, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and OpenCV, to segment (cardiovascular magnetic resonance) CMR images.
- Implement and trained the deep learning based model through augmenting provided training dataset.
- Model had an accuracy score of approximately 0.83 at labelling CMR images into the following classes: background, left ventricle , right ventricle and myocardium - shown on the rightmost tile in figure 2 below.

### [Project 3: Representational Similarity Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/Taranks7/RDM_researchproject) ### 

- create representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) for participants using pairs of stimuli, reflecting Euclidean distances between stimuli
- the formed matrix characterizes the representation of the stimuli in an individual's brain or a computational model
