# Taranjit's Portfolio # 
This is a portfolio of some of the data science and machine learning based projects I have worked on.

### [Project 1: Representational Similarity Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/Taranks7/RDM_researchproject) ### 

- create representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) for participants using pairs of stimuli, reflecting Euclidean distances between stimuli
- the formed matrix characterizes the representation of the stimuli in an individual's brain or a computational model

Figure 1. RDM for participant 1; 0 represents most similar pairs of stimuli and 0.05 represents least similar pairs.

### [Project 3: Deep learning based CMR image segmentation](https://github.com/Taranks7/OpenCV_segmentation) ### 
- Developed an automated process, using convolutional neural networks (CNN), to segment (cardiovascular magnetic resonance) CMR images.
- Implement and trained the deep learning based model through augmenting provided training dataset.
- Model had an accuracy score of approximately 0.83 at labelling CMR images into the following classes: background, left ventrcle, right ventricle and myocardium.
